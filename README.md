# Paternoster Lift
This repository contains the code for a paternoster lift implemented on the Nexys A7-100T FPGA board.
The lift uses a finite state machine for each floor, and the on-board 7-segment display is used to 
display the lift's floor number. The on-board switches are associated with the elevator's stopping mechanism. 

The paternoster lift is a type of elevator that consists of a continuously circulating chain of cars. 
The cars are open on all sides, and the passengers can step on and off the car as it passes by. 
Paternoster lifts are typically used in low-rise buildings, such as office buildings and schools.
